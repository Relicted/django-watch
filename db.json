respective respective careers, about which each has extreme passion. Mia is an actress who dropped out of college and moved from small-town Nevada five years ago to pursue her dream. She is enamored with old-tome Hollywood - the movies she grew up on - but hates the cattle-herding feeling of going on auditions and her belief that she needs to schmooze at social events to get ahead in the business. Sebastian is a jazz pianist, his style of jazz in the vein of traditionalists Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. He wants to do his part to preserve that tradition, especially as he knows that that style of music is dying. He has trouble emotionally playing music he doesn't like just to get a paying gig. He dreams of opening his own jazz club, most specifically in what used to be a famous jazz club that has since been converted to a tapas-bar-cum-salsa-dance-club. Partly because of their individual struggles and partly because of the situations, their first few chance meetings are antagonistic. But they eventually become attracted to each other largely because of the passion for their dreams that they see in each other. But there are many obstacles to a happily-ever-after. They may be able to endure the struggling-artist life for so long before those struggles take their toll. The pursuit of their individual dreams may take all their energies with nothing left for their relationship. And any compromise each may make in getting ahead may change the person with whom each has fallen in love.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Musical", "Romance"], "news": [9]}}, {"model": "videos.video", "pk": 13, "fields": {"created_at": "2017-11-06T14:09:19.541", "updated_at": "2017-11-06T14:09:19.541", "content": "series", "series_status": 1, "original_title": "Suits", "poster": "video_posters/suits-30c002a3-b428-4e95-b6fb-b545851831c3.jpg", "description": "While running from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross, a brilliant young college-dropout, slips into a job interview with one of New York City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "news": [7, 6]}}, {"model": "videos.video", "pk": 14, "fields": {"created_at": "2017-11-06T14:12:36.664", "updated_at": "2017-11-06T14:12:36.664", "content": "series", "series_status": 1, "original_title": "The Blacklist", "poster": "video_posters/theblacklist-076614e6-3cc0-4a8c-9deb-f54c52a8bb87.jpg", "description": "Elizabeth Keen lives a happy live with her husband Tom.

After a tense trial where Harvey's new nemesis tried to use Donna against him, Mike (Patrick J. Adams) swooped in to push Donna to tell Harvey how she really feels \u2014 something she's been debating for the last 10 episodes.\r\nDonna is more a woman of action than words though, and she decides to tell Harvey the truth with a passionate kiss. He wasn't expecting it, of course. Donna left him in her office with his jaw on the floor as she left apologizing, \"I'm sorry, Harvey. I just needed to know.\"\r\nSuits: Rick Hoffman Breaks Down Louis' Game Changing Decision\r\nThe problem is, we don't know what that kiss revealed. Did it confirm for Donna that she belongs with Harvey or did it do the opposite? Is she running out of the room to find her ex or is she going to drown herself in whiskey because Harvey is already in a committed relationship? We won't know until the show returns, but USA hasn't renewed it for a Season 8 yet.\r\nHarvey has been in denial this entire season about the potential for him and Donna to be \"more\" and has given himself over to his new relationship while Donna grappled with her disappointment. Now he'll have to figure out his own feelings for the woman who has always known him better than he knows himself. We, of course, want to know exactly what that kiss meant to Harvey as well.\r\nSuits 100th Episode: Donna Isn't Sure Harvey Is \"The One\"\r\nUnfortunately, Donna's declaration couldn't come at a worse time. She dropped the bomb as Harvey was still reeling from the fact that Jessica (Gina Torres) was disbarred. Her name will have to be stripped from the wall of Pearson Specter Litt \u2014 clearing the way for her own series set in Chicago \u2014 making Harvey's ownership of the firm official. As talented as Harvey is, he's never been that good at juggling too many emotional things at one time. It's entirely possible that Harvey will choose to focus on work rather than Donna's proposition.\r\nIt's been considered inevitable for Donna and Harvey to end up together, but Suits has found a way to re-raise those questions with added stakes, and created an even foggier path to their endgame than ever before.\r\nThe latest twist just proves what Suits fans already know \u2014 this show is better than anyone at the \"Will-they-won't-they\" game. This question has been haunting fans for seven full seasons now. The smartest shows manage it three or four seasons tops before having to fully dive into their proposed one true pairing. Donna and Harvey are an inevitable endgame for Suits, but the show continues to find ways to twist the couple in different directions without giving in to actually putting them together.", "main_picture": "news_poster/eb2df315-d66f-4be2-8689-88aad315dbf5-suits-pulls-off-another-darvey-cliffhanger.jpg", "category": [1]}}, {"model": "news.post", "pk": 7, "fields": {"created_at": "2017-11-06T15:03:03.298", "updated_at": "2017-11-06T15:03:03.298", "article": "Suits: Rick Hoffman Breaks Down Louis' Game Changing Decision", "description": "The team finally seems like it's on the same page on Suits, but a game changing move in Louis' personal life could blow it all up.", "user": 1, "text": "The 100th episode of the USA legal drama, directed by series star Patrick J.

Now Louis has re-entered the romantic ring with the woman who tore his heart out and everyone knows that Louis can either be the firm's biggest asset or its largest liability depending on how emotionally stable he is.\r\nTV Guide talked to Hoffman about Louis' decision to show up for Sheila's indecent proposal, the potential fallout and what this could mean for the firm going forward.", "main_picture": "news_poster/67620e18-3b1b-4e72-be9f-a859551df84a-suits-rick-hoffman-breaks-down-louis-ga_pNhO18a.jpg", "category": [1]}}, {"model": "news.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"created_at": "2017-11-06T15:05:43.964", "updated_at": "2017-11-06T15:05:43.964", "article": "The Blacklist: Red Reasserts His Influence, at Harold's Expense", "description": "This season of The Blacklist began with a depowered Red Reddington (James Spader).

A few weeks ago, he made his presence known to an already conflicted Ressler (Diego Klattenhoff). This week, it was Harold's (Harry Lennix) turn to be pulled more directly into Red's orbit.\r\nWhen Harold revealed that he needed some personal time off to help out the son of an unknown friend, Red swept into action, offering his services \u2014 Dembe, mostly \u2014 to the ever-moralistic special agent. Harold being Harold, he declined Red's nebulous-but-nefarious solicitation, only to find himself caught in the middle of a sloppy shootout and foot race. Of course, Red didn't take no for answer and Dembe was there to save Harold at the absolute perfect time of need.\r\nThe Blacklist's Boss Explains Those Bones and the Surprising Reunion\r\nFrom there, Red did his thing: convincing someone they need his help just long enough to push them into making a dangerous choice. He carried out some advanced interrogation techniques on a potential suspect while a discombobulated and befuddled Harold stood by and watched. After the interrogation resulted in quality intel, Red refused to accompany Harold on his mission to confront the likely criminal intimidating his friend's son. Instead, he suggested that Harold had to make the choice on his own: revenge or justice.\r\nHarold being Harold, no blood was shed. Only one punch was thrown. The leader of the task force could, in no good conscience, take his already off-book operation even further off-book.\r\nOn one hand, this story all came out of nowhere, as if the show simply decided that the sixth episode of the season was about the time to give Harold and Harry Lennix something substantive to do.

Here are a few big factors:\r\n\r\n1. Each installment feels unique\r\n\r\nOne common critical complaint of the pre-\u201cAvengers\u201d Marvel films is that they often felt cookie-cutter, sticking to a tried and true formula. While Marvel hasn\u2019t completely departed from that formula, it has shown an increasing willingness to experiment with its heroes in different genres and to allow directors to show their own individual styles.\r\n\r\nThe 2017 MCU films reflected this approach: \u201cGuardians 2\u201d continued the irreverent, musical tone that director James Gunn introduced in the first \u201cGuardians\u201d three years ago and which is often credited with encouraging Marvel to take more risks.", "main_picture": "news_poster/c04fcf16-2121-48a7-b3d9-e178b2d475bc-5-reasons-why-marvel-studios-is-having-_Y9uuqNh.jpg", "category": [7]}}, {"model": "comments.usermessage", "pk": 2, "fields": {"created_at": "2017-11-06T17:22:35", "updated_at": "2017-11-06T17:22:35", "type": "suggestion", "theme": "dasd", "user": 1, "text": "asdasdasd", "approved": false}}]
